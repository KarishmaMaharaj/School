						The <b>Caroni Swamp</b> is the second largest mangrove wetland in Trinidad &amp; Tobago. It is located on the west coast of Trinidad, south of Port of Spain and northwest of Chaguanas, where the Caroni River meets the <i>Gulf of Paria</i>.
						The Caroni Swamp is an <mark>estuarine system</mark> comprising 5,611 hectares of mangrove forest and herbaceous marsh, interrupted by numerous channels, and brackish and saline lagoons, and with extensive intertidal mudflats on the seaward side. This swamp is an important wetland since it is ecologically diverse, consisting of marshes, mangrove swamp and tidal mudflats in close proximity. The wetland provides a variety of habitats for flora and faunal species and as such, supports a rich biodiversity. It is highly productive system that provides food and protection and is a nursery for marine and freshwater species.

				<h2> The Swamp is known for many different species such as:</h2>
				
			 <ul>		
					<li>Caimans</li> 
					<li>Swamp Boas </li>
					<li> Scarlet Ibis </li>
					<li> Crab of different types </li>
					<li> Fishes</li>
				    
			</ul>

					<h2> Educational Usage / Eco-tourism </h2> 
			
						
						<p> The Caroni Swamp is visited by <em>thousands of eco-tourists per year</em>. This is important to local communities. The Caroni Swamp is not only an attraction for tourism but it also provides goods and services to local communities and to the Island of Trinidad. For example the swamp provides coastal storm surge protection, carbon sequestration <strong>(the uptake and storage of carbon by trees and plants that absorb carbon dioxide)</strong>, and sediment filtration for near-shore ecosystems. In 2011 a project was started in order to evaluate the TEV, total economic value, of the Caroni Swamp. The study looks at the way the Caroni Swamp provides for Trinidad and Tobago and to the wider Caribbean. The study will also predict the potential damage that climate change can have on wetlands and ecosystems such as the Caroni Swamp. This study could provide strategies for preventing damage to other wetlands as well. </p>
